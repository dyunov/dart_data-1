description: Using the field of two elements $F_2$, let $S=F_2[M]$ where $M$ is the
  monoid of nonnegative real numbers under addition.  The required ring is $R=S/I$
  where $I$ is the ideal generated by elements of $M$ greater than $1$.  (The elements
  look like linear combinations of elements from the interval $[0,1]$.)
